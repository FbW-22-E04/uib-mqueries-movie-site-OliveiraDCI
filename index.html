      <h2 class="title">Instinct (1999 film)</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom max-width">
        <b>The film examines the mind</b> of anthropologist Ethan Powell
        (Hopkins) who had been missing for a few years,
        <b>living in the jungle</b> of Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable Forest with
        <b>mountain gorillas</b>. He is convicted of killing and injuring
        several supposed Wilderness Park Rangers in East Africa, and is sent to
        prison. A bright young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Gooding), tries to
        find out why he killed them, but becomes entangled in a quest to learn
        the true history and nature of humankind, stating that civilization has
        steadily destroyed the natural world, advocating that humans abandon
        this. Eventually it is revealed that during the course of Powell's stay
        with the gorillas, they accepted him as part of their group; he was
        attempting to protect his great ape family when the poachers arrived and
        started shooting them. He gets a hearing to reveal the truth, but an
        attack by a vicious guard on another prisoner causes Powell to be
        reminded of the killed gorillas, at which point he violently attacks the
        guard to stop him, is restrained and stops talking again. At the end of
        the film, Powell escapes from prison using a pen to dig out the lock on
        a window, and heads back to Africa.
